Discord Webhook Spammer
This Python script is designed to send repeated messages to a specified Discord webhook, which can be customized with a bot username and avatar URL. Users can set a message limit or opt for an infinite loop and control the delay between messages. The script handles rate-limiting gracefully and provides feedback to the user.

Features:
Webhook Spamming: Send messages to a Discord webhook continuously or for a specified number of messages.
Custom Username & Avatar: Option to set a custom bot username and avatar URL for the messages.
Rate-Limiting Handling: Automatically detects and handles rate limits (HTTP 429 status code) with retries.
User Interaction: Prompts the user for input such as webhook URL, message content, avatar URL, bot username, and spam settings (message limit, delay).
Infinite Spamming Option: Send messages indefinitely (with an option to stop by closing the program).
Notes:
The tool is intended for educational purposes or testing only.
Use responsibly and avoid spamming or abusing Discord webhooks.
